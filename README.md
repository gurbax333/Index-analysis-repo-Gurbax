# Enriching Stock Market Data using the OpenAI API

This is a project I completed, where I used the **OpenAI API** to classify companies from the **Nasdaq-100** (headquartered in California) into sectors and summarize their year-to-date (YTD) performance.  
It demonstrates how large language models can enrich and automate financial data analysis.

## üìä Project Overview
- **Goal:** Classify Nasdaq-100 companies into sectors and generate insights about sector-level stock performance using AI.  
- **Input Data:**  
  - `nasdaq100_CA.csv` ‚Äî Nasdaq-100 companies headquartered in California.  
  - `nasdaq100_price_change.csv` ‚Äî YTD price change data for each ticker.  
- **Process:**
  1. Merge the two datasets on the company ticker symbol.
  2. Use the OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` model to classify each company into one of ten sectors:
     *Technology, Consumer Cyclical, Industrials, Utilities, Healthcare, Communication, Energy, Consumer Defensive, Real Estate, Financial.*
  3. Summarize overall sector performance and identify top-performing sectors and companies.
